# Battleship


Ever wanted to play battleship but didn't have the board? Ever get tired of the little red and white pegs getting everywhere afterwards?

Well then this game is for you! Written in C++, this program has all the aspects of the classic game that you need.

This software was written as my first dive into the C++ language, and as such uses all the simple features of the language.
 I use classes, functions, and data structures like maps, to accomplish the task in the language.

Here is a link to a demonstration video of the program and my code.

# Development Environment

I used CLion by JetBrains to write and run my program in the C++ language without any libraries besides the built-in fstream and iostream.
